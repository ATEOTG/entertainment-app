## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript
- SCSS/SASS
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

### What I learned

I wanted to apply what I've learned from the backend course by Jonas Schmedtmann into a project. By doing this, I was able to learn how to use Node, Express, MongoDB, and even TypeScript. 

### Continued development

After working on this project I hope to develop my skills in terms of backend features such as resetting the password, emailing users that signed up, and adding a functionality that will allow admins to create more media entries(movie/tv). If I had to continue developing this project, I would also add a rating system and add a favorite section for users. 

### Useful resources

- [Backend Node,Express, and MongoDB course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/) - This helped me learn Node, Express, and MongoDB.
- [React + TypeScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/) - This awesome course helped with React + TypeScript.
